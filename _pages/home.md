I'm a master's student in Psychology at the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/index.html">University of Munich</a> (LMU).

I’m interested in how children come to understand and obtain knowledge about the world, and how they produce corresponding explanations. What role do explanation-seeking curiosity and exploration play in these processes, and what does that teach us about human intelligence?

Relatedly, I’m also curious about how we can encourage curiosity and playful exploration both in formal and informal learning environments, especially K-12 science education. What are ways to design and use learning technologies to provide learners with personalized and engaging experiences, addressing their individual needs and interests?

In my free time, I sometimes <a href="/writings/">blog</a> and dabble in small <a href="https://github.com/adaniabutto">webdesign / data viz / misc. coding projects</a>. I always enjoy exchanging ideas with others, so please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:adaniabutto@gmail.com">reach out!</a><br><br>
