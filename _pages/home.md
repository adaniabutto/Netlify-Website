I'm a <b>master's student in Psychology</b> at the <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/index.html">University of Munich</a> (LMU).

I’m <b>interested in how children come to understand and obtain knowledge about the world, and how they produce corresponding explanations</b>. What role do <em>explanation-seeking curiosity</em> and <em>exploration</em> play in these processes, and what does that teach us about human intelligence?

Relatedly, I’m also curious about how we can encourage curiosity and playful exploration in formal and informal learning environments, especially <em>K-12 science education</em>. What are ways to design and use <em>learning technologies</em> to provide learners with personalized and engaging experiences?

In my free time, I sometimes <a href="/writings/">blog</a> and dabble in small <a href="https://github.com/adaniabutto">webdesign / data viz / misc. coding projects</a>. I also always enjoy exchanging ideas with others, so please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:adaniabutto@gmail.com">reach out!</a><br><br>
